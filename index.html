                <p class="text">When I told my 9-year-old daughter that I was going to a bootcamp at Georgia Tech, a couple of weeks later, when she was trying to make fun of me, she said “you know Dad, you’re so dumb, you’re having to go back to school!”. She has no
                    filter on some of her comments at the moment! But it does raise a valid question of how I ended up enrolled in the class.</p>
                <p class="text">I was born in Scotland, and played a lot of rugby, tennis and golf growing up. I majored in Economics at the University of Edinburgh although I started off studying Engineering and then switched to Economics after the first year because
                    I wasn’t sure that Engineering was the right path for me - there have been many times when I wish I hadn’t make that decision. But the lesson I learned later was that perseverance is an invaluable quality and has many rewards. Anyway,
                    after college, I worked for an asset management company in Edinburgh but I got a bit restless and had always wanted to live in the U.S. (I had visited here many times for work and vacation).</p>
                <p class="text">So, I did an MBA at UC Berkeley – and loved the lifestyle and the location. After graduating, I got a job in San Francisco but the company got bought out after a few years by UPS. I moved to Atlanta as there weren't many jobs in SF at
                    the time. I worked for UPS in various Finance and HR (Compensation) roles for a total of 18 years. However, I knew that I had to something different, so I left UPS in February and have been taking a number of courses in the ‘big data’
                    field, but the importance of programming is universal it seems and I'm looking for a new set of "future-proof" skills (if that's really possible!) for the next phase of my career. So, here I am!
